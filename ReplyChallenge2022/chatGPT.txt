To fight the demons, Pandora’s character consumes a special resource called
stamina. She starts the quest with a certain amount Si of stamina, consumes
it when battling enemies and recovers it after some time until she reaches a
maximum amount of Smax. Exceeding stamina will be lost.
The quest involves a total of T turns. In each turn you can decide to face one
from a list of D demons. Each demon is defined by:
• Sc: stamina lost by Pandora after defeating the demon
• Tr: number of turns needed to recover stamina after the fight
• Sr: amount of stamina recovered Tr turns after the fight
• Na: number of turns in which you’ll earn fragments for defeating the demon
• List of Na elements where 8ai; i 2 [0;Na) : ai 2 N. Each ai represents the
number of fragments earned in the i􀀀th turn after the fight for performing
the ritual to put the fragments back in the jar
You need to provide the list of demons you want to face in the journey.
As Pandora:
• You cannot defeat more than one demon in the same turn
• You can only face a demon if you have enough stamina
• You cannot fight the same demon more than once
• After defeating a demon you will recover some stamina after a certain number
of turns have passed
• Your stamina will always be included in the interval [0; Smax]
• The reward mechanism processes the list of demons you decided to face,
in the order you faced them. If you don’t have enough stamina to face an
enemy, the system will wait until you have enough stamina required to face
the demon or the total number of turns have passed.
• In any given turn, you first recover your stamina, then face an enemy, then
collect the fragments
• In each turn, if applicable, you recover all the fragments that every defeated
demon has granted you
• In each turn, if applicable, you recover all the stamina that every defeated
demon has granted you
• You can collect fragments and facing demons for a maximum of T turns.
After that, no other demon can be faced nor any fragment can be collected.
Your total score is the sum of fragments you collected at the end of T turns.

2 Input format
The input file is a regular ASCII text file. Each line of the input file is separated by
a single “\n” character “UNIX-style”). If a line contains multiple data, each value
is separated by a single whitespace character. The first row of the input file will
be composed of 4 integer numbers:
• The integer Si is the amount of stamina the player starts with
• The integer Smax is the maximum amount of stamina you can cumulate
during the fight
• The integer T is the number of turns available
• The integer D is the number of demons available
Then, D lines follow, each describing one demon. Each demon line contains the
following integer data:
• The integer Sc is the amount of stamina points you consume to face the
demon; you cannot face a demon if you don’t have at least this amount of
stamina;
• The integer Tr is the number of turns you have to wait before recovering
stamina;
• The integer Sr is the amount of stamina that you recover after Tr turns
have passed;
• The integer Na is the number of turns you’ll earn fragments after defeating
the demon;
• A sequence of Na integers ai; i 2 [0;Na) represents the amount of fragments
you’ll earn in the i-th subsequent turn after the fight.
3 Output format
The output file must be a regular ASCII text file. Each line of the output file must
be separated by a single “\n”. Each line of this file must contain the 0-based
index of the demon to face. The demons will be faced in the order provided.
The output file is valid if:
• it contains only numbers and newlines
• for each index i; i 2 [0;D)
• each index is present in the file only once

4 Scoring rules
Given a list E of N defeated enemies, En is the n-th enemy, Tn is the turn in
which the n-th enemy is defeated, An is the list of fragments for the n-th enemy,
of length len(An), and An[i] is the i-th reward of the list.
T is the number of turns in the simulation.
Given an enemy En, the reward Rn obtained by defeating them is the sum
of all the accumulated fragments starting from the turn in which the enemy is
defeated, before the end of the simulation:
Rn =
min(len(AXn);T􀀀Tn)􀀀1
i=0
An[i] (1)
The total reward R is the sum of all the scores:
R =
NX􀀀1
i=0
Ri (2)
Formally:
T ! number of turns in the simulation
E = [E0;E1; :::;En􀀀1] ! enemy
T = [T0; T1; :::; Tn􀀀1] ! turn in which the Ei enemy is defeated
AE0 = [A0;A1; :::;An] ! reward array for enemy E0
AE1 = [A0;A1; :::;Am] ! reward array for enemy E1
:::
Rn =
P
0imin(len(AEn);T􀀀Tn)􀀀1 AEn[i] ! score for enemy N
R =
P
0iN􀀀1 Ri ! total score
